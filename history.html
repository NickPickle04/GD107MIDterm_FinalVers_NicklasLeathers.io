<!--Paragraphs-->
  <p class="phistory1">Keith Haring was born on May 4th, 1958 in Pennsylvania. At a very young age he developed an interest in drawing, especially from cartoons like Dr.Seuss or Walt Disney.<br>
  <br>Soon after high school he enrolled at the Ivy School of Professional Art. However, after spending two semesters at the university, Haring decided drop out as he had no interest in being a commericial artist.
  </p>
  <p class="phistory2">After moving to New York in the early 80s, Keith would flourish in the alternative art community. This spark of inspiration is what would lead him to a path of fame.
  While riding the subways, he noticed a lot of unused advertising panels made with paper. This is where his iconic art style would become famous.</p>
